# miscka
kano IRC addon with auxiliary features, like baking a cake

A simple addon to a long-since-defunct IRC client, XiRCON. 

## Notes
This is dedicated to Sergio Arizmendi. I wrote this back in 2002 at the tender age of 18. So assuming this does still work - and people still use kano - it is dedicated in honor of that crazy Mexican. Shine on you crazy, irascible bastard.
